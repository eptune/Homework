Homework 9

Hardware:
2GHz MacBook with 1GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM

The relavent code for this project is in the pi.py module.  I implemented the Monte Carlo estimation of pi in the mcpi function.  The function `benchmark` will loop over mcpi using one of the following methods:
Simple - Execute as fast as possible using single core.
Process - Execute using two processors
Thread  - Execute using 2*num_cpu threads.

Performance curve is in:
performance_curve.pdf

To generate yourself:
import pi
pi.plotloop() # warning takes about 2 minutes to generate.

The Simple method worked best for ndarts < 300
The process method is *almost* twice as fast for high ndarts.
