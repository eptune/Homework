    Made cofe plotting function up to date.
    
    Changed how I display the carbon to oxygen ratio.  I plot the C/O on
    a number scale and [Fe/H] on the sun-normalized log scale.  I also
    differentiate between the planet and the non-planet hosts.

    Added the median error bar for the metalicity abundance trends.  Having a
    hard time adding this to the temperature systematics.

    Added the population flag keyword to starsdb
    
    Made the plotting program a class.
    Added a function to plot how the abundance trends with iron.

    Worked on the temperature systematics fitter.
    
    starsdb:
    Added o_abund_nt and c_abund_nt to save the non-corrected abundance
    Also if mkdb detects the table already exists, kill it.
    
    Modified postfit to work with the databases as opposed to stars structure
    
    Created a new postfit.applytfit that updates the _abund columns to hold
    the temperature-corrected abundance.

    Fixed problem with exo planet cuts.
    
    I was applying select distinct mystars.o_abund which throws out duplicate
    abundances NOT duplicate stars.  Must run a select distinct on the *Stars*

    Added KS test that shows whether the planet sample and the comparison
    sample are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution.
    
    Also changed around some of the histogram aesthetics.  I could do more,
    but this is good for now.

    Exoplanet Histograms.
    
    Added exo function in plotgen which plots the different histograms of
    abundances for stars with and without planets.
    
    Modified the starsdb program to include iron in the data base.

    Database is setup to read files in from luck06.  The error bars are poorly
    defined, but I need to move on.
