I created a repository on github.  You can find the files by searching for the 
user `eptune` at github.

The files are here

I started using git to track the changes I was making on my python :-) code base
for my research as well as edits I make to a paper I am working on. See.

and

I turned HW5 into a package, and now the user can load the `poll.py` module
from any directory.  I also made a wrapper for this program using the argparse
module, so the functionality can be called from the command line.


---------------------------------------------------------------
~/Python/Homework/HW8>python qpoll.py -h
usage: qpoll.py [-h] [-C STATE] [-N] [-t TIME] [-d DEM] [-r REP] [-i IND]

Polling Function

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -C STATE    Pop a chart of current state
  -N          Added new information to database
  -t TIME     Days since Jan 1
  -d DEM      Democratic Polling Data
  -r REP      Republican Polling Data
  -i IND      Independent Polling Data
---------------------------------------------------------------

For example type:

python qpoll.py -C "Florida" 

To pop the latest results from Florida.  I had trouble implimenting the 
functionality to add new data.  There is some intricacy of sqlite3 that I 
don't understand.

Lastly, I downloaded the bloom git repositorly.  I fixed the bugs and made the
commits as per the INSTRUCTIONS.
